## Overview

### Description
It is an app that collects information from many game databases (like Steam, Epic Games, etc) and allows the user to make their own comprehensive list (games/consoles purchased, upcoming games they want (wishlist), on-sale watchlist) from all the databases.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Gaming/Video Games (Social & Entertainment)
- **Mobile:** Mobile ensures easy accessibilty, which is convenient for gamers. There will be use of audio or video to play game trailers, push notifications to let users know of upcoming sales, and real-time data from the gaming sites, and location and maps usage to ensure deals and sales are relevant to the user's region and time zone.
- **Story:** Gamers tend to have multiple gaming libraries on multiple consoles and would have a hard time accessing or organizing all of them, this is the solution. It would also help them see which games are on sale without having to connect to 50 different sales-watch apps. Young adults, our peers, love gaming and we all have different gaming systems and those of us on PC either use Steam, Epic Games, Ubisoft, EA, or another site to get games and it sometimes becomes too much keeping track of it all; they would really like a centralized and personalized gaming database.
- **Market:** Any gamer, casual or competitive, could use this app. More people have collectively spent time gaming than there has been in Earth's history, so potentially the user base is endless. This app would greatly help the ever growing gaming community.
- **Habit:** Gamers would use this app daily to check sales and update their lists. The average user would create personalized lists, so they would not just be consumers.
- **Scope:** This app would be technically challenging as it would require frequent API calls to multiple frequently updating sources. A stripped down version of this app would still be interesting, as it would only shrink the number of sources we pull from, meaning the user would still have an extensive library to pick their games from. Finally, this app is clearly defined in both the frontend and the backend since the backend would handle a lot of API calls and database management and the front end would focus on having the correct links to different gaming sources.
