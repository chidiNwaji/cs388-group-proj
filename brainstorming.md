## New App Ideas List (John Anigbogu)
1. Sports Team Database (finding player's names and images in order to make some sort of recycling page showcase all of a team's players/coaches)
2.  Fluids Tracker - for example, you can upload records of what drinks you took the day and record how many mL's you took for the day. Like if you take Gatorade, gatorade fluid information comes up and can be added, and it totals the fluid intake amount. For the week, it gives you an average.
3. Word Database - Get a dictionary that has many words in the English language, including uncommon words, and the words least commonly used can be picked by the users, and they can choose to learn those words for fun to use on their peers to "blow their minds".


## New App Ideas List (Tayyab Nabeel)
1.  "Gamer's Vault" tracker (across multiple game libraries) - collect information from many game databases (like Steam, Epic Games, etc) and allows the user to make their own comprehensive list from all databases

    -> https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532096678169150062
    
2. "Shoe Vault" tracker (similar to Gamer's Vault) - collect and track information on specific shoes, use databases that hold all shoe releases as well as store prices, color washes, release dates, and variations.

3. "Emulator shelf" tracker (pc/mobile tracker for emulator) - variation of Gamer's Vault but instead of games, tracks emulators for different consoles. Also if said emulators are on mobile and downloaded, you can launch directly from the app. Hold info such as version, console info, game compatibility with versions, and all releases.


## New App Ideas List (Daniel Montoya)
1. Convention & Cosplay Tracker (suggests nearby conventions based off user interests & also gives cosplay ideas and websites to buy them or ways to make them)
2.  Movie/Show Tracker (Lets you list shows/movies you plan to watch and check off where you left off within runtime or episode. It will also show you where to watch. Periodically reminds you about shows and movies you have in progress)
    -> https://developer.imdb.com/  
3. Surge Pricing tracker (lets you know when different rideshare apps have higher or lower pricing)


## New App Ideas List (Chidiebube Nwaji)
1. Running Tracker that connects with other users and ranks best achievements (furthest run, fastest mile, top speed, etc) and helps organize local races (for fun and charity)
2.  Work Conferences App -> connects a employer/HR employee to work conferences and events relevant to their industry
3. AI Rapper -> a ChatGPT wrapper that only speaks in poem styles, and can be played as a rap song

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. "Gamer's Vault" App
   - **Description**: collect information from many game databases (like Steam, Epic Games, etc) and allows the user to make their own comprehensive list (games/consoles purchased, upcoming games they want, for-sale watchlist) from all databases; API usage is definitely a necessity in this app, and the APIs are free to use.
   - **Category:** Gaming/Video Games (Social & Entertainment)
   - **Mobile:** Mobile ensures easy accessibilty, which is convenient for gamers. There will be use of audio or video to play game trailers, push notifications to let users know of upcoming sales, and real-time data from the gaming sites, and location and maps usage to ensure deals and sales are relevant to the user's region and time zone.
   - **Story:** Gamers tend to have multiple gaming libraries on multiple consoles and would have a hard time accessing or organizing all of them, this is the solution. It would also help them see which games are on sale without having to connect to 50 different sales-watch apps. Young adults, our peers, love gaming and we all have different gaming systems and those of us on PC either use Steam, Epic Games, Ubisoft, EA, or another site to get games and it sometimes becomes too much keeping track of it all; they would really like a centralized and personalized gaming database.
   - **Market:** Any gamer, casual or competitive, could use this app. More people have collectively spent time gaming than there has been in Earth's history, so potentially the user base is endless. This app would greatly help the ever growing gaming community.
   - **Habit:** Gamers would use this app daily to check sales and update their lists. The average user would create personalized lists, so they would not just be consumers.
   - **Scope:** This app would be technically challenging as it would require frequent API calls to multiple frequently updating sources. A stripped down version of this app would still be interesting, as it would only shrink the number of sources we pull from, meaning the user would still have an extensive library to pick their games from. Finally, this app is clearly defined in both the frontend and the backend since the backend would handle a lot of API calls and database management and the front end would focus on having the correct links to different gaming sources.


2. Movie/Show Tracker
   - **Description**: Lets you list shows/movies you plan to watch and check off where you left off within runtime or episode. It will also show you where to watch. Periodically reminds you about shows and movies you have in progress; API usage is a necessity for pulling data from streaming sites but some of the APIs are private or gone (like the one for Netflix), and therefore inaccessible.
   - **Category:** TV/Movies (Entertainment)
   - **Mobile:** Mobile ensures ease of access for when people want to keep track of what they watch without having to go home to check their streaming services' accounts. It can also be used concurrently with other streaming apps that are on their phones. It will use push notifications to do the reminders and audio/video to play the trailer for the show/movie they want to watch.
   - **Story:** Everyone likes to watch movies and shows without having to go to the theatres and buy expensive snacks and tickets. There are also so many different streaming sites that it is hard to keep track of what they watch. This app is a great way to coordinate between different streaming services. Our peers love to binge watch many shows and movies, and there are so many out there, so it is hard to keep track of it all. This would be a good way for them to do so.
   - **Market:** Anyone who frequently watches movies/TV shows on the go or even at home. Millions of people watch shows every year, and it is not really a niche group of people who do so, but cinephiles (people who love movies and shows) would love a way to track their favorites.
   - **Habit:** TV show bingers, movie watchers, and everyone in between will weekly check this app to keep track of the media they consume. The average user will be creating a lot on this app.
   - **Scope:** This app would be technically challenging as it would require database maintenance, API calls to multiple sources, and handling a lot of moving parts in the backend. A stripped down version of this app would be basic to build, as it would just be a list only. Finally, this app is clearly defined.


3. Fluids Tracker
   - **Description**: You can upload records of what drinks you took the day and record how many mL's you took for the day. For example, if you take Gatorade, gatorade fluid information comes up and can be added, and it totals the fluid intake amount. For the week, it gives you an average. If the fluid intake is less than the recommended for the day (either based on body weight or national recommendations), a reminder is sent out to drink liquids and record it.
   - **Category:** Health & Fitness and Productivity
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential because people drink water while they are on the move or typically when they are away from their laptop, so having it on their phones would make it more accessible and practical for spontaneous fluid consumption. It will not require use of APIs but it could use push notifications to remind the user and it could also use the camera to take a picture of the bottle/container they drank from.
   - **Story:** Everyone drinks liquids, and its good to keep track of what you drink and how much. If there are any health problems, it would be easy to rule out a symptom of dehydration if you keep track of what you drink. Our friends would not really like this idea because it only tracks fluids and makes it more of a companion app to a fitness app that already tracks this.
   - **Market:** Health and fitness people, and those who overall want to keep track of their health. The user base is potentially endless, and with the rise of the fitness movement among young adults, it would be a great value for the "FitTok" part of the Internet ("FitTok" is the part of TikTok where fitness influencers thrive).
   - **Habit:** Athletes can use this to watch their intakes while doing competitive competition, and regular people could use this every day while they drink fluids. The average user will be consuming the app instead of creating.
   - **Scope:** This app would be extremely easy to complete and a stripped down verison of this app would not be that interesting to build. The project is not that intricate that it needs specific definition of features.
